#### Why do we perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)?
As a first step in machine learning, it is important to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA). This step is crucial because it helps us clean and preprocess the data so that we can achieve the best possible model performance. By ensuring that our data is balanced, we can increase the accuracy of our models and improve their overall effectiveness. EDA is widely regarded as a best practice in machine learning and is an essential step for anyone looking to develop high-quality models. With the insights gained from EDA, we can make informed decisions about how to proceed with our modeling efforts, ultimately leading to better outcomes.

#### What will we find out through this EDA?
In this EDA, we will be performing tasks to :
1. Identify missing values.
2. Estimate Skewness and Kurtosis.
3. Correlation Heat Map.
4. Scatter plot for different parameters.
5. Replace categorical values with numerical values (i.e., America 1, Europe 2 etc.).

#### Where will we perform the EDA?
The EDA will be performed in Jupyter Notebooks, which I have locally installed. The Auto-mpg dataset that is used, has been taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/autompg-dataset).
